âœ… Problem Statement: Student Grades Based on Marks
ğŸ”· Description
You need to design a program that calculates grades based on marks for each subject a student has appeared for. The marks for different subjects are stored in an array. Based on the marks, corresponding grades should be calculated and stored in another array.

ğŸ”· Class: Student
Instance Variable	Type	Description
marks	int[]	Array storing marks in different subjects
grade	char[]	Array to store calculated grades

ğŸ”· Constructor:
Student(int[] marks)
Initializes marks array with the values passed.

Initializes grade array with the same size as marks.

ğŸ”· Methods:
void findGrade()
Calculates the grade based on the following rules:

| Marks Range      | Grade |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| `>= 92`          | E     |
| `>= 85 and < 92` | A     |
| `>= 70 and < 85` | B     |
| `>= 65 and < 70` | C     |
| `< 65`           | D     |


Stores the result in the grade array.

int[] getMarks()
Returns the marks array.

void setMarks(int[] marks)
Sets the marks array.

char[] getGrade()
Returns the grade array.

void setGrade(char[] grade)
Sets the grade array.

ğŸ”· Assumptions:
The minimum mark can be 0 and maximum mark can be 100.

ğŸ”· Sample Input:
marks = {79, 87, 97, 65, 78, 99, 66}
ğŸ”· Expected Output:
Grades corresponding to the marks are :
B A E C B E C
